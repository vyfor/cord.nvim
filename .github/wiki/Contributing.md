# ðŸ“— Contribution Guidelines

Thank you for your interest in contributing to cord.nvim! This document provides guidelines for contributing to the project.

## Project Structure

cord.nvim consists of several key components:

- **Lua Plugin**: The main Neovim plugin code located in `lua/cord/`.
- **Server Component**: The server responsible for managing multiple Neovim instances and IPC communication located in `src/`.
- **Documentation**: Wiki pages are pulled from `.github/wiki/`.
- **Assets**: Icons are now stored in a separate repository, [vyfor/icons](https://github.com/vyfor/icons).

## Versioning

We use a modified versioning scheme (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH):

- **PATCH**: Backward compatible changes (features and fixes)
- **MINOR**: Breaking changes
- **MAJOR**: Significant architectural changes

## How to Contribute

### Contributing to the Lua Plugin

Cord detects different buffers based on current buffer's filetype, and on rare occasions, its filename. If it's not listed, it's either:
- Not yet added to Cord. You can submit a PR, or open an issue and let us handle it.
    - The code responsible for this is in `lua/cord/plugin/activity/mappings.lua`.
- Cannot be detected by Cord.
    - This is often the case for plugins, so make sure the plugin you're contributing overrides the current buffer's filetype option so that it can be detected.

If you'd like to contribute a built-in plugin that might be useful for many users, you can add it in `lua/cord/plugins/`.
