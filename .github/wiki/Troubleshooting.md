# üîß Troubleshooting

Having trouble with Cord? This guide provides solutions to common problems and scenarios you might encounter.

## üõ†Ô∏è General Troubleshooting Steps

If you're experiencing issues, try these general steps first:

1.  **Check Plugin Loading**: Ensure `cord.nvim` is correctly loaded. Try running a Cord user command like `:Cord status`. If it's not recognized, the plugin may not be installed or loaded correctly.
2.  **Restart Neovim**: Sometimes a simple restart of Neovim can resolve temporary issues.
3.  **Update Cord**: Make sure you are using the latest version of Cord, as well as the server executable, which can be updated using `:Cord update`.
4.  **Check Discord Activity Privacy**: Verify your Discord [Activity Privacy settings](https://github.com/vyfor/cord.nvim/assets/92883017/c0c8c410-e90e-425e-bf10-8b59f04f15ce) are enabled to allow Rich Presence to be displayed.
5.  **Enable Logging**: Set `log_level = vim.log.levels.TRACE` in your `cord.setup()` configuration. Then check `:messages` for detailed logs that might indicate the problem. Remember to revert to a less verbose log level (e.g., `vim.log.levels.WARN` or `vim.log.levels.OFF`) after troubleshooting.
6.  **Run `:checkhealth cord`**:  This command performs health checks and can identify common configuration or environment issues.
7.  **Ensure Discord IPC Pipe Exists**: Check if the Discord IPC pipe exists on your system:
    - **Windows (PowerShell):** `Test-Path \\.\pipe\discord-ipc-0`
    - **Unix (Bash):** `find /tmp /var/run /run -type s -name 'discord-ipc-*' 2>/dev/null`
    If the command returns nothing or "False", the pipe may not be available.

If these general steps don't resolve your issue, look for specific problems and solutions below.

## üö´ Rich Presence Not Showing in Discord

If Cord is loaded but your Rich Presence is not appearing in Discord, try these solutions:

- **Web/Custom Discord Client**:
    - **Problem**: The web version of Discord and some custom Discord clients may not expose the necessary IPC (Inter-Process Communication) pipe for Rich Presence.
    - **Solution**:
        - **Use Official Discord Client**: Use the official Discord desktop application (download from [https://discord.com/download](https://discord.com/download)).
        - **arrpc Bridge (for Web Discord)**: If you must use web Discord, you can try using [arrpc](https://github.com/OpenAsar/arrpc) to create a bridge. Follow arrpc's instructions to set up the bridge between your browser and Cord.

## üéõÔ∏è No Buttons Showing in Rich Presence

- **Problem**: You've configured buttons in your `cord.setup()`, but they are not visible in Discord.
- **Solution**:
    - **Discord UI Bug**: There's a known client-side bug in Discord related to user profiles. *You may not be able to see buttons on your own Rich Presence*.
    - **Verify with Others**: Ask a friend or someone else to check your Discord profile to see if they can see the buttons on your Rich Presence. Buttons often *are* visible to others even if you can't see them yourself.
    - **Voice Channel Hover**:  Another workaround to check buttons yourself is to join a voice channel in Discord and hover over your name in the voice channel list. Buttons may appear in the hover tooltip.

## ‚è±Ô∏è Rich Presence Timer Stuck at 00:00

- **Problem**: The elapsed time timer in your Rich Presence is stuck at "00:00" and not updating.
- **Solution**:
    - **System Date & Time**: This issue is almost always caused by an incorrect system date, time, or timezone setting on your computer.
    - **Sync System Clock**: **Ensure your system date, time, and timezone are set correctly and synchronized** with a reliable time source (e.g., using NTP - Network Time Protocol).  Operating systems usually have settings to automatically sync time.

## üíª Running Cord in Specific Environments

### üåê Using Discord in a Browser

- **Challenge**: Discord running in a web browser does not expose the IPC pipe that Cord needs to communicate with it directly.
- **Solution**: **arrpc Bridge**: Use the [arrpc](https://github.com/OpenAsar/arrpc) bridge as mentioned earlier. arrpc creates a communication bridge that allows Cord to send presence updates to web-based Discord. Follow arrpc's setup instructions carefully.

### üêß Running Inside WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux)

- **Challenge**: WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux) does not directly expose Windows pipes by default, which are needed for Discord IPC.
- **Solution**: **socat and npiperelay**: Use `socat` and `npiperelay` to create a bridge that exposes the Windows Discord IPC pipe to WSL.
    1.  **Install `socat` in WSL**: `sudo apt-get install socat` (or your distribution's package manager command).
    2.  **Download `npiperelay.exe`**: Download `npiperelay.exe` from [https://github.com/jstarks/npiperelay/releases](https://github.com/jstarks/npiperelay/releases) and place it in a directory accessible from WSL (e.g., `/mnt/c/path/to/npiperelay.exe`).
    3.  **Alias `nvim` with Pipe Relay**: Add an alias to your WSL shell configuration file (`~/.bashrc`, `~/.zshrc`, etc.) to launch `nvim` with the pipe relay setup. Example alias:

        ```sh
        nvim() {
            if ! pidof socat > /dev/null 2>&1; then
                [ -e /tmp/discord-ipc-0 ] && rm -f /tmp/discord-ipc-0
                socat UNIX-LISTEN:/tmp/discord-ipc-0,fork \
                    EXEC:\"/mnt/c/path/to/npiperelay.exe //./pipe/discord-ipc-0\" &
            fi

            if [ $# -eq 0 ]; then
                command nvim
            else
                command nvim "$@"
            fi
        }
        ```

        **Adjust the path to `npiperelay.exe` in the alias if needed.**
    4.  **Use `nvim` Alias**:  Always launch Neovim using the `nvim` alias you defined in WSL.

### Remote Server (SSH)

- **Challenge**: Running Neovim on a remote server via SSH and displaying Rich Presence on your local Discord client.
- **Solution**: **SSH Port Forwarding**: Use SSH port forwarding to tunnel the Discord IPC socket over SSH. Follow the guide in this article: [https://carlosbecker.com/posts/discord-rpc-ssh/](https://carlosbecker.com/posts/discord-rpc-ssh/)
